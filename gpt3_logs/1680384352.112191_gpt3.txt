how to start a compost

RESPONSE:

bin

There really is no "right" way to start a compost bin, but there are a few things you can do to get it started. Try adding some chopped up fruit and vegetable scraps, some coffee grounds or tea leaves, and a little bit of soil or compost. Mix everything together well and keep the bin in a warm, moist place. Give it a few weeks and you should start to see some compost forming!
